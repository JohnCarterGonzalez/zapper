# Survivor-like version roll out guide:

Each version is expected to be finished in between 1-3 weeks. Each version will 
be broken down into two blocks for the purpose of dividing responsibility. each
block will be assigned to either Pascal or John, the blocks are not concrete 
divisions so if one individual completes their block first they are expected to 
ask where they can be of help in the other in order to finish the version and 
move on.
